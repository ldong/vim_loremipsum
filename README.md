A dummy text generator.

I've put this [loremipsum vba](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2289) in to Vundle friendly format.


## Description
Insert a dummy text of a certain length. Actually, the text isn't
generated but selected from some text. By default, the following text is
used, which is included in the archive:
http://www.lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet.com/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet.html

NOTE: The webpage didn't contain any copyright message but there is a
statement that one is allowed to paste the text into "your document".
I thus assume it's ok to include it in the archive. If not, please let me know.

**Command**:

```
:Loremipsum[!] [WORDCOUNT] [PARAGRAPH_TEMPLATE] [PREFIX POSTFIX]
    Insert some random text.

:Loreplace [REPLACEMENT] [PREFIX] [POSTFIX]
    Replace the random text with something else or simply remove it.
```
